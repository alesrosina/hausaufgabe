A little homework
=================

Step Navigation
---------------

Build on the basis of a given design (see `design.png`) the necessary HTML and CSS for all necessary breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile)

* HTML goes to `html/step-navigation.html`, CSS to `css/style.css`
* Find a responsive solution for mobile.
* Please note that the solution should be kept as universal as possible (language etc.)
* Browser Support: IE9+. FF, Chrome and Safari: most recent version.

Please use about 2h to complete the task (max 3h). It's okay if not everything is complete & perfect (just mention it where you would have needed more time). Please write a note afterwards if you want to further explain or clarify things.

We're looking forward to seeing what you'll come up with!
