<h1>Simple demo for navigation menu</h1>

<p>
  I have used SASS and Grunt for easier creation of CSS, where I have used some helper tools:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Autoprefixer</b>: Prefixes all css properties, that are not covered by default in given browsers</li>
  <li><b>Cssnano</b>: Minimizing CSS file (removing all comments, whitespaces, etc.)</li>
  <li><b>SASS</b>: CSS precompiler.</li>
  <li><b>Normalize.css</b>: Used for normalizing all DOM elements for various browsers.</li>
  <li><b>include-media</b>: SCSS mixins for media queries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For mobile I have chosen a solution, where a user would have a back button and current step. It does indicate
  which step user is currently visiting and allows a user to go back, but a downside of this approach is, that a user
  does not see how many steps are in front of him.<br/>
  This might be solved by using "accordion style" (see image below) of navigation, where a user would see how many steps there are, and
  could also navigate around steps.<br/>
  Both solutions works on different use cases, so it really depends on actual use case of this example.<br/>
  I have also choose a solution with back button due to time constraint, since accordion solution would require a bit more
  brainstorming on how to achieve it with not too much of messing with clean HTML.
